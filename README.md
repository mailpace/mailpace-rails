[MailPace](https://mailpace.com) lets you send transactional emails from your app over an easy to use API.

The MailPace Rails Gem is a plug in for ActionMailer to send emails via [MailPace](https://mailpace.com) to make sending emails from Rails apps super simple.

> **New in 0.4.0: [Idempotent Requests](https://docs.mailpace.com/guide/idempotency/), Improved Error Handling, InReplyTo and References support**

> **New in 0.3.0: The ability to consume [inbound emails](https://docs.mailpace.com/guide/inbound/) from MailPace via ActionMailbox**

##  Usage

Once installed and configured, continue to send emails using [ActionMailer](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html) and receive emails with [ActionMailbox](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailbox_basics.html) like normal.

## Other Requirements

You will need an MailPace account with a verified domain and organization with an active plan.

## Installation

### Account Setup 

Set up an account at [MailPace](https://app.mailpace.com/users/sign_up) and complete the Onboarding steps

### Gem Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mailpace-rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install mailpace-rails
```

### Configure the Gem

First you will need to retrieve your API token for your sending domain from [MailPace](https://app.mailpace.com). You can find it under Organization -> Domain -> API Tokens.

Use the encrypted secret management to save your API Token to `config/credentials.yml.enc` by running the following:

```bash
rails secret
rails credentials:edit
```

Then add your token:

```yaml
mailpace_api_token: "TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
```

Set MailPace as your mail delivery method in `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :mailpace
config.action_mailer.mailpace_settings = { api_token: Rails.application.credentials.mailpace_api_token }
```

## Tagging

You can tag messages and filter them later in the MailPace UI. To do this, pass the tags as a header by adding a tag variable to your `mail` method call.

```ruby
class TestMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: 'notifications@example.com',
          to: 'fake@sdfasdfsdaf.com'

  def single_tag
    mail(
      tags: 'test tag' # One tag
    )
  end

  def multi_tag
    mail(
      tags: "['test tag', 'another-tag']" # Multiple tags
    )
  end
end
```

Note that this should always be a string, even if using an array of multiple tags.

## List-Unsubscribe

To add a List-Unsubscribe header, pass a `list_unsubscribe` string to the `mail` function:

```ruby
class TestMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: 'notifications@example.com',
          to: 'fake@sdfasdfsdaf.com'

  def list_unsub_header
    mail(
      list_unsubscribe: 'https://listunsublink.com'
    )
  end
end
```

## ActionMailbox (for receiving inbound emails)

As of v0.3.0, this Gem supports handling Inbound Emails (see https://docs.mailpace.com/guide/inbound/ for more details) via ActionMailbox. To set this up:

1. Tell Action Mailbox to accept emails from MailPace in `config/environments/production.rb`

```ruby
config.action_mailbox.ingress = :mailpace
```

2. Generate a strong password that Action Mailbox can use to authenticate requests to the MailPace ingress.
Use `bin/rails credentials:edit` to add the password to your application's encrypted credentials under `action_mailbox.ingress_password`, where Action Mailbox will automatically find it:

```yaml
action_mailbox:
  ingress_password: ...
```

Alternatively, provide the password in the `RAILS_INBOUND_EMAIL_PASSWORD` environment variable.

3. Configure MailPace to forward inbound emails to `/rails/action_mailbox/mailpace/inbound_emails` with the username `actionmailbox` and the password you previously generated. If your application lived at `https://example.com` you would configure your MailPace inbound endpoint URL with the following fully-qualified URL:

`https://actionmailbox:PASSWORD@example.com/rails/action_mailbox/mailpace/inbound_emails`

That's it! Emails should start flowing into your app just like magic.

## Idempotent Requests

Mailpace supports [idempotency](https://docs.mailpace.com/guide/idempotency) for safely retrying requests without accidentally sending the same email twice. This is useful to guarantee that an email is not sent to the same recipient multiple times, e.g. through a network error, or a bug in your application logic.

To do this, when writing your mailer, generate and add a unique `idempotency_key`:

```ruby
class TestMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: 'notifications@example.com'
  def idempotent_mail
    email = 'email@example.com'
    mail(
      to: email,
      idempotency_key: Digest::SHA256.hexdigest("#{email}-#{Time.now.to_i / 3600}")
    )
  end
end
```

## ActiveStorage Configuration

This gem depends on ActiveStorage for handling inbound emails. If you do not have ActiveStorage configured in your Rails App you may need to create an empty file `config/storage.yml` for this Gem to work.
